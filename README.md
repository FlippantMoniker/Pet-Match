Pet adoption matching game for children

This is an educational game for children, to be created and gifted to a Texas-based 501(c)(3) non-profit animal sanctuary. 
It is to be created without monetization.

In this game, the player runs a growing pet-adoption sanctuary, and will have to find the best humans to adopt their dogs. The focus will be on matching humans to dogs, to satisft the needs and requirements of the animals--not the humans. This is to quietly educate players that humans are stewards, not owners. As the players make matches, they earn stars, which they then trade in for sanctuary upgrades. The game concludes when the final upgrade is purchased.

Pet care advice comes throughout the game, as sanctuary team members appear with tips and information during game play. These tips come mostly as upgrades are purchased.
